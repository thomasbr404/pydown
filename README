# PyDown
### The simple markdown editor

This is PyDown, an incredibly simple python markdown editor made with tkinter, tkhtmlview, and markdown2.

- It works much the way you would expect:
	- It can do bullet points.
	- It can handle code blocks
	- It's basically as simple as it gets while still being really functional.

If I had wanted this to be really awesome, I'd have used a different framework than tkinter, like PyQt, which has better html support.

## Plans for the future:
- Add syntax highlighting
- Add other exportable file types
- Make it also convert markdown to html for nice formatting and expanded use.
- Also just generally improve the gui. It kind of sucks right now, but it's tkinter, I don't know what I expected.
